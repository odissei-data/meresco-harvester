Migration from Meresco Harvester 7.2.x to Meresco Harvester 7.3
'ignored' was a misnomer, renamed to 'invalid' because we also
want to log the last InvalidDataException message that was not ignored.


Sketch of possible migration script:


from os import rename
from os.path import isdir, isfile, join

ignoredPath = join(logDir, "ignored")
if isdir(ignoredPath):
    rename(ignoredPath, join(logDir, 'invalid'))
for domainName in domainNames:
    ignoredIdsFilePath = join(stateDir, domainName + "_ignored.ids")
    if isfile(ignoredIdsFilePath):
        rename(
            ignoredIdsFilePath,
            join(stateDir, domainName + "_invalid.ids")
        )
