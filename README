1. Installation
---------------
Seecr (Seek You Too B.V.) provides a Meresco Software repository to ease the installation of e.g. Meresco Harvester. For Debian and Redhat based systems see http://repository.seecr.nl for instructions to configure your package manager to use this repository.

Installation using the Meresco Software Repository:
    - install python-meresco-harvester with your package manager.

For other systems or source based installation look at the 'deps.txt' file for all dependencies. Sources can be downloaded from http://meresco.org/sources
Installation can be done with python distutils.
    $ python setup.py install

2. Configuration
----------------
Furthermore you will need to configure:
    - sitecustomize.py !!
    - webcontrolpanel administrator (admin)
    - harvesting (user)

2.1 SSL Certificate creation
------------------------------
    If you don't have an SSL Certificate for your server you can create your
    own self-signed certificate.
      Create a server key.
        $ openssl genrsa -out server.pem 2048
      Create a certificate. Fill in some information. BEWARE: As Common Name (CN)
      fill in your domainname, e.g. harvester.example.org
        $ openssl req -new -key server.pem -out server.csr
      Now create a self-signed certificate.
        $ openssl x509 -req -days 60 -in server.csr -signkey server.pem -out server.crt
    In order to enable HTTPS, the usage of Nginx is highly suggested. 


2.2 Sitecustomize.py !!
-----------------------
    "Meresco Harvester" requires 'utf-8' as defaultencodig. This can be
    done with a file sitecustomize.py somewhere in your pythonpath. A usual
    place for your sitecustomize.py is /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/
    The contents should be:
        import sys
        sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')

    The webcontrolpanel does not work if the encoding is different.

2.3 Webcontrolpanel Configuration
---------------------------------
    To access the webcontrolpanel users will need a name and password. 
    The special user 'admin' can create these. An initial password for this
    user must also be created.

2.3.1 Meresco Harvester Server
------------------------------
    An example configuration file is given in the examples directory, 
    see 'harvester.config'.
    We recommend using daemontools (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) for
    running this service.
    The service is then started using the script 'meresco-harvester-server'.

2.3.2 User administration
-------------------------
    The webcontrolpanel has one special user called 'admin', with extra privileges.
    Amongst these privileges is the right to create users. This is all done
    in the webcontrolpanel. 

    Each user has it's own line in this file in the format:
        <username>:<md5sum of password>

    To start using the "Meresco Harvester" you will need to provide it with one
    admin user, a default usersfile is in the example directory. It contains the
    admin user with the password 'admin'.

2.3.2.1 Changing the admin password
---------------------------------
    To create a password for the user admin you can do:
      $ echo "admin:$(echo -n <yourpassword> | md5sum | awk '{print $1}')" > users.txt


2.4 Harvesting configuration
-----------------------------
    Harvesting is done with the 'meresco-harvester' script.
    The user that will run the 'meresco-harvester' script will need to have
    read/write permissions in the stateDir and logDir specified in the
    configuration.
